										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I could if you hadn&#8217;t turned on the light and shut off my stereo. Check it out, y&#8217;all. Everyone who was invited is here. Daddy Bender, we&#8217;re hungry. No. We&#8217;re on the top.</p>
<p>I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though! Yeah, and if you were the pope they&#8217;d be all, &#8220;Straighten your pope hat.&#8221; And &#8220;Put on your good vestments.&#8221; Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
<p>Is that a cooking show? Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&#8217;d cease to exist! When the lights go out, it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>
<p>I love you, buddy! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn&#8217;t you just get me the death penalty? And I&#8217;d do it again! And perhaps a third time! But that would be it. I found what I need. And it&#8217;s not friends, it&#8217;s things.</p>
<p>I love you, buddy! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Shut up and get to the point! No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don&#8217;t own!</p>
<p>Ok, we&#8217;ll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we&#8217;ll go ride the bumper cars. Michelle, I don&#8217;t regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I saw you with those two &#8220;ladies of the evening&#8221; at Elzars. Explain that.</p>
