										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn&#8217;t ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Bender, being God isn&#8217;t easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
<p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you&#8217;d cease to exist! I never loved you. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. We don&#8217;t have a brig.</p>
<p>Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Fry! Stay back! He&#8217;s too powerful! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There&#8217;s only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!</p>
<p>Stop! Don&#8217;t shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Ugh, it&#8217;s filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we&#8217;re at it? Kif might! Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers.</p>
